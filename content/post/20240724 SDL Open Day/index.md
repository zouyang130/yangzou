Today, our Smart Digital Lab held an incredibly successful open day, attracting over 100 students, academics, and industry professionals. Attendees had the unique opportunity to explore cutting-edge research in intelligent infrastructure and digital construction being done at the UoA Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

Our open day highlighted several key themes, such as BIM, Construction Automation, Reality Capture, Drone, Laser Scanning, Scan-to-BIM, Infrastructure Management, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality. 

Visitors enjoyed hands-on experiences with tools such as virtual reality and mixed reality headsets, drones, laser scanners, simulation games, and robotic dogs. These immersive experiences provided a comprehensive look at the innovative technologies driving our research.

Huge thanks to the entire team (Roy Davies, Cheng Zhang, Ajay Agrawal, Salik Khan, Zhengxing Chen, Tao Yang, Li Xu, Zhen Zhang), for organizing such a successful event! If you're interested in learning more about our work, please don't hesitate to reach out.
