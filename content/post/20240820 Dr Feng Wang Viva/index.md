On 20 August 2024, Feng Wang successfully defended his PhD oral examination and officially became Dr. Wang! His PhD research focused on Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)-based bridge inspection, investigating novel approaches for 3D UAS path planning to reconstruct high-quality 3D models, accurately position UAS in GPS-denied areas, and perform near real-time quality checks for inspection imagery data. Congratulations to Dr. Wang!

Dr. Wang began his PhD on 20 August 2019, and today, exactly five years later, he has reached this significant milestone.

He is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Hong Kong. Best wishes to Dr. Wang for his future career! We look forward to more collaboration with him in the future.
