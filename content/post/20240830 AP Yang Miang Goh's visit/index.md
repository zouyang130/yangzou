On 30 August 2024, Associate Professor Yang Miang Goh from National University of Singapore (NUS), visited our Smart Digital Lab at University of Auckland. His seminar on safety analytics was truly interesting and insightful. We look forward to building a closer connection with A/Prof Goh and NUS Department of the Built Environment.

We had more than 30 participants who joined us via Zoom and in person. Thank you all for your support and interest!
