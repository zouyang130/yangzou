**Summary**: Fast search & rescue (S&R) and emergency assessment of building conditions are critical in the case of major earthquakes. Current practices are, however, often conducted by human, which is labour intensive, dangerous and subject to errors. The project aims to analyse the feasibility of developing an intelligent robotic system prototype that can perform efficient post-earthquake S&R and emergency assessment of building conditions by applying various state-of-art digital technologies. It focuses on understanding New Zealand needs and testing technologies to develop an overall framework for the proposed robotic system.

**Funder**: Building Research Association of New Zealand (BRANZ)

**Team**: **Yang Zou (PI)**, Jason Ingham (University of Auckland)

**Duration**: 2020
