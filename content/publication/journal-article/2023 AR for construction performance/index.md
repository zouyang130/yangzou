abstract: There is a growing interest in exploring the use of wearable Augmented Reality (AR) devices to improve the task performance of construction workers. However, user interaction with AR has not been well understood in the current literature, which may result in poor usability, occupational hazards, and low acceptance. To bridge this gap, this study introduced cognitive ergonomics theory to design and develop an AR application for improving the kinaesthetic performance of construction workers conducting onsite assembly tasks. The methodology of this study is three-fold. First, articles in relation to cognitive ergonomics were reviewed to propose a unique cognitive model that reveals the cognitive mechanisms of construction workers, including human information processing, selective attention, and attention resources. Second, the characteristics of existing AR application functions were synthesised to develop a customised and user-friendly wearable AR application that aligns with the identified cognitive mechanisms. Third, a rebar-tying experiment was conducted to validate the developed AR application. The results indicate that the experimenters instructed by the application can complete the task independently without the need to seek after expert assistance; the application has a potential to foster the skill development of construction workers and enhance their kinaesthetic performance; and the proposed cognitive model and the AR development principles are well aligned from the perspective of cognitive ergonomics, which could promote the uptake of wearable AR in the construction industry.
