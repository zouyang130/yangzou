abstract: 'While Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used for building façade inspections, their advantages have not been fully leveraged due to the challenge in gaining a fast and holistic understanding of as-is building conditions from fragmented images. This paper describes a framework to address the problem by registering UAV images into a Building Information Model (BIM) in three phases: (1) Extract position and optical parameters from UAV images to configure virtual cameras in BIM and generate template images; (2) Employ an improved generalised Hough transform (GHT) to extract building façade components with arbitrary shapes; (3) Project UAV images onto an orthophoto and incorporate them into 2D and 3D views. Finally, a Dynamo prototype is developed to automate the process. Computer simulations and field experiments confirmed a mean image-to-BIM registration error of within 21 mm, demonstrating the proposed approach has the potential to facilitate UAV-enabled building façade inspection.'
