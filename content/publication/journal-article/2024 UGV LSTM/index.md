abstract: Current solutions for monitoring the progress of pavement construction (such as collecting, processing and analysing data) are inefficient, labour-intensive, time-consuming, tedious and error-prone. In this study, an automated solution proposes sensors prototype mounted unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) for data collection, an LSTM classifier for road layer detection, the integrated algorithm for as-built progress calculation and web-based as-built reporting. The crux of the proposed solution, the road layer detection model, is proposed to develop from the layer change detection model and rule-based reasoning. In the beginning, data were gathered using a UGV with a laser ToF (time-of-flight) distance sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope and GPS sensor in a controlled environment. The long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm was utilised on acquired data to develop a classifier model for layer change detection, such as layer not changed, layer up and layer down. In controlled environment experiments, the classification of road layer changes achieved 94.35% test accuracy with 14.05% loss. Subsequently, the proposed approach, including the layer detection model, as-built measurement algorithm and reporting, was successfully implemented with a real case study to test the robustness of the model and measure the as-built progress. The implementation of the proposed framework can allow continuous, real-time monitoring of road construction projects, eliminating the need for manual, time-consuming methods. This study will potentially help the construction industry in the real time decision-making process of construction progress monitoring and controlling action. This first novel approach marks the first utilization of sensors mounted UGV for monitoring road construction progress, filling a crucial research gap in incremental and segment-wise construction monitoring and offering a solution that addresses challenges faced by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and 3D reconstruction. Utilizing UGVs offers advantages like cost-effectiveness, safety and operational flexibility in no-fly zones.
