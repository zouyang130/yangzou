Building information modelling (BIM) is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of the physical and functional characteristics of buildings and other physical assets. BIM is supported by various tools, technologies and contracts. Building information models (BIMs) are computer files (often but not always in proprietary formats and containing proprietary data) which can be extracted, exchanged or networked to support decision-making regarding a built asset.

The **CIVIL743 BIM** at the University of Auckland aims to provide both undergraduate and postgraduate students a comprehensive exploration of the evolutionary journey of BIM. By the end of this course, students will: (1) grasp the concept and significance of BIM; and (2) acquire a solid understanding of the three technological foundations of BIM: geometric modelling, data modelling, and process modelling. Additionally, this lecture will extend beyond the realm of BIM to illuminate the emerging concept of Digital Twins, offering a glimpse into the future trajectories of digital transformation in the AECO industries.
