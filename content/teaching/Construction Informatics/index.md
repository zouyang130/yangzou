CIVIL305 Construction Informatics is a new course for year-3 undergraduate students at the University of Auckland. It is all about reality capture technologies (e.g., drone mapping, 3D reconstruction, laser scanning, LiDAR) and generation of meaningful deliverables (e.g., BIM models) from reality models (in the format of point cloud). This course is designed to include a series of assignments and a final project to help students strengthen their theoretical understanding and master hands-on skills. The assignments are to help them know how to use reality capture technologies, how to convert point cloud into BIM, and how to further develop new designs to meet new needs. Then, students must combine what they have learned to complete a final project, which requires them to work in groups to mix their civil knowledge, modelling/surveying skills and design thinking to complete the re-design of our Trimble lab.
